# Git Workshop
In this workshop we will focus on three sections:
1. How to write a commit message?
2. Rebasing your own work
3. Rebasing on the base branch

## How to write a commit message?
A good commit message is a way to communicate with your colleagues and future yourself.<br/>
Please follow [this article](https://wiki.bloopark.com/display/BPIT/How+to+Write+a+Git+Commit+Message) for more details.

## Rebasing your own work
 Rebase can be used to add/change/remove your commits directly from your own branch too! The “base” on which you rebase can be virtually any commit — even a direct ancestor.

In fact, if you wanted to see what was happening during the rebase we did, you could have used the “interactive mode” of rebase by adding the `-i` or `–interactive` argument. By doing so, Git will open your editor of choice (the one defined in your `EDITOR` environment variable) and list all of the commits that will be affected by the rebase operation, and what should be done with every single one of them. This is where the true power of `rebase` lies.

From your editor, Git lets you reorder, rename, or remove commits, but you can also split single commits into multiples, merge two or more commits together, or change their commit messages at the same time! Pretty much everything you’d like to do with your history is possible with `rebase`. And the awesome thing is that it’s relatively straightforward to tell Git what to do. Every commit is presented on its own line, in a sequential order, prefixed by the command that will get applied to it. Reordering commits is as easy as reordering lines, with the most recent commits at the bottom of the list. Removing commits is just a matter of removing the corresponding line, or specifying the `d` or `drop` command as a prefix. One of your messages contained a typo? Just use the `r` or `reword` command to keep the commit, but change the associated commit message.

To sum up, `rebase` is just a Git command that lets you:
- Select one or multiple sequential commits
- Base them on any commit of your repository
- Apply changes to this commit sequence as they are added on top of the new base commit

## Rebasing on the base branch
In September 2016, GitHub introduced [a new way to merge pull requests:](https://github.blog/2016-09-26-rebase-and-merge-pull-requests/) the “Rebase and merge” button. Also available for other repository managers such as GitLab, it’s the “rebase front door”. It lets you perform a single rebase operation of your Pull Request commits on top of your base branch and then perform a merge. It is very important to observe that those two operations are performed in order, and that the rebase is not a substitution of the merge. Hence rebase is not used to replace the merge, but it completes it.

Consider the previous example. Before the final merge, we were in this situation:

You can simulate what happens when you click on the “Rebase and merge” (when there’s no conflict) by performing the following commands:

```bash
git checkout new-feature
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge new-feature --ff
```

By doing so, you finally end up with a “linear history”:

As you see, rebasing is not a substitution for the merging step. As explained before, the two operations are not performed on the same branch: `rebase` is used on the feature branch whereas `merge` is performed of the base branch. For now, this operation just prevents having a single merge commit with all the changes in it, and it’s still a single operation that happens at the last step of your contribution (i.e., when you want to share your work).

Until now, we have only interacted with `master` as our base branch. To stay in sync with the changes of the base branch, it’s just a matter of performing the rebase step with the up-to-date base branch. The longer you wait to do this, the more out of sync you’ll be.

The up-to-date version of your base branch is hidden in plain sight. It’s a read-only version of the base branch, prefixed with the name of the remote to which you’re connected, or more simply put: it’s a read-only copy of the branch from your remote instance (such as GitHub or GitLab). The default prefix when you are cloning the repository for the first time is `origin`. More concretely, your `master` branch is the local version of master, whereas `origin/master` is the remote version of this branch, copied on your computer the last time you performed a `git fetch` operation.

We’ve stepped through a lot of theoretical material, but as it turns out, the end result is relatively straightforward; here’s how to sync with changes happening on the remote:

```bash
git fetch
git checkout my-new-feat
git rebase origin/master
```

The first step retrieves the latest changes from the distant copy of `master` into your local `origin/master` branch. The second one checks out your feature branch. The last one  performs the `rebase` so that all your commits are now added on top of the latest changes that happened parallel to your own work. By applying those commands on our very first example, here is what would have happened:
